# BoomEngine
A top down shooter 3D Ray Tracing Engine
This prject will be made into two parts:
## Part 1: The MapBuilder (Editor)
This is where you will design the maps and level design for your game.

## Part 2: The Engine
This is where it will run your map and you will be able to walk around it.
You will need to import the Art folder and the MapData into the same directory as the Engine itself.
